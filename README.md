# FMG2ParamName
 Reads FMGs and attempts to write the names to unknown Param Rows

Still a WIP

If you build this yourself, just replace the path for ExeDir with whatever path you wanna use in the `#if DEBUG` statement

Requires latest [SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats) by [TKGP](https://github.com/JKAnderson/) to build.
